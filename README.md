Threshold Determinant based on Confusion Matrix

- Introduction

 In the Confusion Matrix, We can know how much certain class is misclassified in the other classes.
 In this document, I consider normalized confusion matrix as an prior conditional probabilistic within classes and use this to determining threshold in the classification problem
  - Problem
